# Crater morphology analysis tools


This project aims to provide python codes to analyse crater populations.

This project is still under development


***************
SEMI-AUTOMATIC CRATER MORPHOLOGY EXTRACTION

Compute depth for each crater from a crater map and a DEM alligned on it. Provides a GUI.


CITE: Semi-automated crater depth measurements, Sylvain Breton, Cathy Quantin-Nataf, Thomas Bodin, Damien Loizeau, Matthieu Volat and Loic Lozacâ€™h, MethodX, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2019.08.007



***************
CRATER POISSON DATING

Implement Michael 2016 method do date planetary surfaces using a probabilistic poisson method. Chronology model and size frequency distribution models should be manually set to the wanted model (eg: moon/mars, Hartmann/Ivanov/Neukum...)

CITE: "Planetary surface dating from crater size-frequency distribution measurements: Poisson timing analysis", G.G. Michael, T. Kneissl, A. Neesemann, Icarus, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2016.05.019
 

***************
CRATER MORPHOMETRY STATISTICS TOOLS

Provide several tools to analyse, represent and model crater size and depth frequency distributions.
 
CITE: Insight into Martian crater degradation history based on crater depth statistics, Sylvain Breton, Cathy Quantin-Nataf, Lu Pan, Lucia Mandon, Matthieu Volat, Icarus, submited

REQUIRED INSTALLATION
In order to use those codes you needto install python 3.
Suplementary libraries may be necessary for some codes.
